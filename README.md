## Dataset
CTRLSciTab, a specialized dataset in the scientific domain, comprises 8,967 pairs of tables and their corresponding descriptions. This dataset introduces a novel task: controlled table-to-text generation underpinned by scientific reasoning. The central objective of this task is to produce analytical narratives that not only adhere to the specific knowledge within a given domain but also align with predefined user preferences. It is anticipated that CTRLSciTab will provide a valuable benchmark for future research endeavors in the area of controlled table-to-text generation that incorporates scientific reasoning.
